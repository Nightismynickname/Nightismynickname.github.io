          <li>
            The software doesn’t do something that the product specification says it should do.

            The software doesn’t do something that the product specification doesn’t mention but should.
          </li>
          <li>
            The software is difficult to understand, hard to use, slow, or in the software tester’s eyes – will be viewed by the end user as just not right.

          <p><Strong>
            List of traits that most software testers should have:
          </Strong></p>
          <li>
            They are explorers
            <ul>
              <li>
                Software testers aren’t afraid to venture into unknown situations. They love to get a new piece of software, install it on their PC, and see what happens.
              </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              They are troubleshooters
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Software testers are good at figuring out why something doesn’t work. They love puzzles.
                </li></ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                They are relentless
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Software testers keep trying. They may see a bug that quickly vanishes or it difficult to re-create. Rather than dismiss it as a fluke, they will try every way possible to find it.
                  </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are Creative
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Testing the obvious isn’t sufficient for software testers. Their job is to think up creative and even off-the-wall approaches to find bugs.
                    </li></ul>

                        State testing is concerned with verifying the programs logic flow through its various states.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A software state is a condition or mode the software is currently in.

                      <li>
                        Testing the software state and logic flow has the same problems as data testing . It is usually possible to visit all state (if you can’t get to them why have them).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The difficulty is that except in small programs it is often impossible to traverse all paths to all states.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This is as a result of a software complexity, especially the richness of today user interface, provides so many choices and options that the number of paths grows exponentially.

                      <li>
                        The solution is to apply equivalence partitioning techniques to the selection of states and paths to test, assuming some risk because you will choose not to test all the states, but reduce the risk by making intelligent choices.
